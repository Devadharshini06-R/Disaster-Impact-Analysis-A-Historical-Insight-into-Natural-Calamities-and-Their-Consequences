# 🌪️💥🌋 Disaster-Impact-Analysis-A-Historical-Insight-into-Natural-Calamities-and-Their-Consequences

This data analysis project examines and shows the historical impact of natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and landslides over different time periods.Using a dataset with important metrics such as death tolls, magnitudes, economic losses, depth, and run-up heights, this project reveals trends and connections among various types of disasters.

  ## 📌 Key insights Dashboard


Certain centuries saw an increase in catastrophic events. 

High-magnitude events, especially underwater earthquakes, often lead to tsunamis and large death tolls. 

A few disasters caused most of the economic damage, usually measured in billions of USD. 

Certain regions, like Japan, Indonesia, and Pacific coastlines, are frequently impacted because of their seismic activity zones. 

Some volcanic eruptions with lower magnitudes resulted in surprisingly high fatalities due to secondary effects, such as tsunamis and landslides.
